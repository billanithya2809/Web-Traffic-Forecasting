🌐 Web Traffic Time Series Forecasting 🚀
📄 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and forecasting web traffic sessions data using Time Series Analysis techniques. The primary objective is to predict future website traffic trends, identify patterns, and help in strategic decision-making for content planning, marketing, and server capacity.
 
🔥 Key Features
•	Data Cleaning & Preprocessing of web traffic time series data.
•	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
•	Time Series Forecasting Model using Facebook Prophet.
•	Interactive Visualizations showing actual vs predicted traffic with confidence intervals.
•	Ready-to-deploy Dashboard for monitoring traffic trends and forecasts.
